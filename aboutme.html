  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> I am working toward getting into college. I also want to begging to learn what i want to do for my own business and start saving up money so that i can buy a car and be able to rely on my self to have my own finances and keep track. I would like to get at least 1-2 jobs if I can work it into my schedule.i am working toward these goals bye getting good grades. i am also working towards these goals by looking into what i am interested in and good at so that i know what kinda job i want and what type of business.  i am also keeping everything organized and keeping myself in a good motive to keep things organized.values i consider necessary for my success are responsibilities to be able to take care of myself and lead myself into success without having to rely on others to help me. Another value i consider is spirituality because i know having the right mindset and having good energy and positivity will give me the confidence i need and motivation. patience and constants also be consider necessary for my success so i can grow as i go and stay in a good mental state. A short term goal for me is to start praying more because it helps for me to know someone is listening to my wants and needs and as long as i give i will receive form him. I would also like to start working out so that i can build a healthier body for me for basketball and even just myself so i can feel better about the way i look and present myself. my last goal i would like to stress less and get everything that is a burden in my life dealt with so that i can have the motivation and positive energy. character traits i want to be most know for are fun, smart, funny, athletic, outgoing, leader ship and self-confidence. Achievements i would like to be know for are winning the championships for basketball and being apart of the team. I would also like to be know for starting my own business at a young age and actually making good money and handling it very well. </P>
